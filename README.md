# Golang Full Cycle livestream

This was implemented in last week live from "Esquenta Full-Cycle" who is a pre-event warm up for the real Full-Cycle Imersion.

Here we can see some TDD, Clean Arch and specially, Go!

I did some things different from the original live just for testing, like the UniqueIdentifierService there.
Its cool how the language knows what I am inheritancing, like, I didn't even told her that I was doing a struct that is the implementation of the interface ğŸ˜‚

Coming soon -> I could make a script for creating the database automatically

<small>I like to automate useless stuff ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚</small>
